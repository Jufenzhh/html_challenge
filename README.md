# html_challenge
For this challenge there are two deliverables: part_1_mars_news.ipynb and part_2_mars_weather.ipynb 
The first deliverable part_1_mars_news.ipynb visits the Mars News Website and scrapes the title and preview texts of the articles and stores in a python list of dictionaries 
After the scraping is complete, the script prints the extracted data of titles and texts 
Then the chrome browser is closed after the scraping is complete.
